			<h1> The life of an old gamer </h1>
			<p>
			"Long ago there were RPG's on web browsers called MUD's.  I remember playing them as a child.
			I used to play a web-browser based MUD built on ASCII called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LegendMUD#/media/File:LegendMUD_login_screenshot.png">LegendMUD</a>. I remember believing that ASCII was the name of the company
			who made the game."

			<h3> A new age of gaming dawns</h3>
			
			"Here is a quote from Wikipedia's LegendMUD main page."
			
			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LegendMUD">
			The thematic structure of LegendMUD is based on a literal interpretation of historical legend, with content based on real locales at various points in history, but with mythological elements included as concrete reality.
			LegendMUD was derived from DikuMUD. At present, it features over 8,000 rooms contained within 60 areas.
