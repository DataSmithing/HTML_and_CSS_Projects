					"Long ago there were RPG's on web browsers called MUD's.</span> 
					<br>I remember playing them as a child.
					<br>I used to play a web-browser based MUD built on ASCII called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LegendMUD#/media/File:LegendMUD_login_screenshot.png">LegendMUD</a>. 
					<br>I remember believing that ASCII was the name of the company who made the game."

			"Here is a quote from Wikipedia's LegendMUD main page."
			
			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LegendMUD">
			The thematic structure of LegendMUD is based on a literal interpretation of historical legend, with content based on real locales at various points in history, but with mythological elements included as concrete reality.
			<br>LegendMUD was derived from DikuMUD. 
			<br>At present,&nbsp;it features over 8,000 rooms contained within 60 areas.
